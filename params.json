","body":"### Welcome to robotFramework-DebugUI.\r\nThis is a quick and simple way to debug and develop robotFramework scripts. \r\n\r\n### Rapid debugging\r\nAdd the word 'Debug' in your script and the debugger panel pops up. This lists available commands and lets you quickly try  them interactively. \r\n\r\n### Simple to use\r\nAdd this line to your script settings:  \r\n\r\n    *** Settings ***\r\n    Library   DebugUI\r\n\r\nInsert the word \"Debug\" before the line you want to test.
